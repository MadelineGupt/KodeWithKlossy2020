//design principles
//fill in the gaps feature of developed brains
//law of proximity...
//things that are grouped together, our brains fills in the gaps (think the triangle illusion)
//law of enclosure...
//in design when there is a border, your brain will separate that from other things
//law of similarity...
//when two different objects are together your brain can differentiate better and establish a relationship between them
//example: https://www.qwantz.com/

//color
//grouped into warm, cool, and neutral
//they show emotion and can make the viewer feel calmer or happier

//contrast
//important for the pleasure of the design and for colorblind users
//color combos...
//complimentary = directly across on color wheel
//split complimentary = the colors adjacent to the complimentary color
//analogous = colors right next to each other
//example http://adayinbigdata.com/


//wireframe
//like a roadmap, build before
//visual guide of content and functionality, takes in acc user experience
//how to user navigate? what do buttons look like? design principles being used? etc
